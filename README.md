# Quiz Application

## Overview

This is a React-based quiz application where users can take various quizzes, answer multiple-choice questions, and see their results at the end of each quiz. The app tracks user scores and stores them in the browser's `localStorage`, allowing users to view their progress and results on their profile page.

The application features a clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS, and provides users with an intuitive interface for navigating through quizzes and viewing their performance.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register and log in.
- **Quiz Selection**: Users can select from a list of available quizzes.
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Each quiz consists of multiple questions with multiple answer options.
- **Score Tracking**: After completing the quiz, users receive a score summary with the number of correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.
- **Profile Page**: Displays user details and allows users to view their past quiz attempts.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well across all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React (for building the user interface)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - React Router (for handling navigation between pages)

- **Backend**: 
  - The application uses `localStorage` for storing user data and quiz results, making it a fully client-side solution.
